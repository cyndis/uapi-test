# Host1x UAPI test

This is a test suite to test proper functionality of the Host1x and TegraDRM kernel-user interfaces,
as well as internal driver functionality.

## Compilation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the Rust compiler installed. You can either cross-compile, or build the test suite natively. The easiest way to install the toolchain is by using rustup (http://rustup.rs).

If you are cross-compiling, make sure to install the cross-compilation target.

* For arm64: `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
* For armv7: `rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabi`

Also ensure you have an appropriate linker for the target, most likely GCC.

### Setting up the Makefile

Edit `Makefile` and adjust the `LINKERS` variable to match the names of the linkers you want to use.

If you want to be able to execute the test suite remotely, also set up the other `REMOTE_` variables accordingly.

### Building and running

Run `make build-32` or `make build-64` to build the test suite. You should get a binary called `uapi-test-32` or `uapi-test-64` in the project root directory.

If you set up remote access, you can use `make run-remote-32` or `make run-remote-64` to run the test suite on the target system directly. You can append `ARGS="your arguments"` to run the test suite with command line parameters.
